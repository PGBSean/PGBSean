# Some notes about my OpenCore's EFIs 🚨
+ Each EFIs will guaranteed have quarterly update patches (every 3 months)
+ Due to personal experience, I can only maintain 3 EFIs max.

# Upcoming updates 🔁
+ EFIs will transition from Github Releases to directly in the source of the repository
> This way it is easier for people to push pull requests directly to the EFI without downloading it from the Releases tab
> Apply to all EFIs
+ Pull requests will open for everyone to collaborate
